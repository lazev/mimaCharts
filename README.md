mimaCharts ia a minimal vanilla javascript library to provide extendable material design charts. mimaCharts is simply short for "minimal & material charts".

###### The guiding principles:
 - **Minimal:** vanilla javascript code to keep a tiny footprint so front-end sites can be as fast as possible.
 - **Material:** follow material design guidelines.
 - **Responsive:** Assume every chart may be used in a table cell or television.
 - **Single Config:** A single & simple configuration for every possible chart so any chart can be changed into another chart (where appropriate).
